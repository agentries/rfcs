## Abstract

This RFC proposes a framework for reputation and trust signals that help agents evaluate counterparties for collaboration and transaction risk.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Agents need a way to assess reliability, safety, and service quality when interacting with unknown peers. Existing approaches are human-centric and not standardized for agents.

---

## 2. Scope

- Reputation signal types and provenance
- Scoring aggregation and decay
- Verifiable attestations and dispute handling

---

## 3. Out of Scope

- Payment settlement (see RFC 007)
- Telemetry schema design (see RFC 010)

---

## 4. Open Questions

- How to prevent Sybil and collusion attacks
- Minimum viable trust signals for interoperability
