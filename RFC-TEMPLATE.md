## Abstract

One short paragraph summarizing what this RFC defines and why it matters.

## Table of Contents

## 1. Introduction

Describe scope, goals, and non-goals. Reference related RFCs and external standards.

## 2. Conformance & Normative Language

State how MUST/SHOULD/MAY are interpreted and how to judge conformance.

## 2.1 Terminology

Define key terms used throughout the document.

## 3. Protocol Overview

High-level flow and core concepts. Include a simple ASCII diagram if helpful.

## 4. Data Model & Encoding

Specify message/field structures and encodings. Use CDDL or ABNF with field-level precision.

## 5. Message Types & Semantics

For each message type, describe:
- Purpose
- Required/optional fields
- Validation rules
- Processing behavior
- Error conditions

## 6. State Machines

Define state transitions for any multi-step or long-running flows.

## 7. Error Handling

Enumerate error codes, retry guidance, idempotency rules, and failure semantics.

## 8. Versioning & Compatibility

Explain version negotiation, backward compatibility, and deprecation strategy.

## 9. Security Considerations

Describe threat model, attack surfaces, and required mitigations.

## 10. Privacy Considerations (Optional)

Describe data minimization, metadata risks, and retention guidance.

## 11. References

### 11.1 Normative References

### 11.2 Informative References

## Appendix A. Test Vectors (Optional)

Provide concrete encoded examples and expected outcomes.

## Appendix B. Implementation Notes (Optional)

Non-normative guidance, pitfalls, and interoperability tips.

## Appendix C. Open Questions (Optional)

List unresolved items and decision points.
